# Quiz App

In this app, you can select the category, difficulty and number of questions. After you pick your answer to the current question, you will see if it was the correct answer. At the end of the quiz, there will be a summary. Your score will be stored in your browser's local storage. I used Vue, Vite, Pinia and SCSS to build this app.
